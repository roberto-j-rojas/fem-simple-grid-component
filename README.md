## Overview

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action


### Links

- Live Site URL: [Netlify Preview](https://rj-fem-simple-grid-component.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS/SCSS

### What I learned

I have been creating some sass mixins and functions to make easier the generation of my custom properties and I've been also trying to use utility classes more often to write my CSS code in a more efficient way.

I learned to delete the blue overlay that appears when you press a button or a link in the mobile view using this CSS code line for the CSS reset file:

```css
html{
    -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);
}
```

### Continued development

I keep learning new concepts to improve my HTML and CSS code, that includes semantic HTML for Accesibility, different CSS methodologies and more complex CSS properties.
